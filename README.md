## Description: 

This is a fairly simple Pokemon card mini game built in React that has some fun parts to it. I have used CSS Animate and CSS hover for some fun animation tricks and have borrowed the pictures from the pokemon API. There is some logic created for the game component and different use of components and props to get the desired effects. The game is very simple, just click the "Battle!" button and the two hands are randomly assigned some pokemon. The two hands total EXP is calculated and the winner is shown on the screen. The app is mobile responsive as well.
